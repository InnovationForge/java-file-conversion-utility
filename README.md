# java-file-conversion-utility
To develop a Java utility library for converting files between different formats using Maven.

Design patterns can help in making your file conversion utility library more generic and maintainable. One design pattern that could be particularly useful in this scenario is the Strategy pattern. The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable. This way, you can decouple the algorithm implementations from the client code that uses them.

Here's how you might apply the Strategy pattern to your file conversion utility library:
## Define the Strategy Interface: 
Create an interface that declares the method(s) for file conversion.
## Implement Concrete Strategies: 
Implement concrete strategy classes for different file conversion algorithms.
## Use Context: 
Create a context class that holds a reference to the current strategy and provides a method to set the strategy.
## Client Code: 
Use the context class to perform file conversions using the selected strategy.
